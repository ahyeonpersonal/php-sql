to call global variable in local function, we need to call it by $GLOBALS[]

#CASE1 : in this case, since 'x' is global, you would get error

<?php
  $x=5;
  function something(){
    echo $x;
  }
  
  something();
 ?> 
 
 #CASE2 : attach $GLOBALS[x]
 <?php
  $x =5;
  functon something(){
    echo $GLOBALS['x'];
  }
  
  something();
 ?>
